## Issue Summary

Implement Azure OpenAI integration for the AI Dungeon Master system as specified in [ADR 0005 - Azure OpenAI Integration for AI Agents](../../docs/adr/0005-azure-openai-integration.md).

## Background

According to ADR 0005, we have chosen Azure OpenAI Service as our LLM provider to support the multi-agent architecture of our AI Dungeon Master system. This decision was driven by:

- Need for enterprise-grade reliability and compliance
- Native integration with our chosen Semantic Kernel framework
- Regional deployment options for data residency
- Service level agreements for production use
- Stable pricing model for production deployment

## Current State

### ✅ Already Implemented
- Configuration structure in `backend/app/config.py` with Azure OpenAI settings
- Basic Semantic Kernel setup in `backend/app/kernel_setup.py`
- Environment variables template in `backend/.env.example`
- Required dependencies in `backend/requirements.txt`
- Multi-agent architecture foundation

### ❌ Missing Implementation
- Azure infrastructure provisioning and setup
- Complete API connection validation and error handling
- Comprehensive testing pipelines
- Production-ready configuration management
- Agent-specific model deployment configuration
- Monitoring and observability setup

## Validation Tools

A validation script has been provided to help verify the Azure OpenAI integration setup:

```bash
cd backend
python ../scripts/validate_azure_openai.py
```

This script validates:
- Environment variable configuration
- Required dependencies
- Azure OpenAI service connectivity  
- Model deployment accessibility

Run this script after completing each phase to ensure proper setup.

## Requirements (Per ADR 0005)

### Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] **Azure OpenAI Resource Provisioning**
  - Create Azure OpenAI service instance
  - Configure appropriate region based on data residency requirements

## Architectural Guidelines Compliance

This implementation must adhere to the architectural decisions outlined in ADR 0005:

- **Enterprise Reliability**: Use Azure OpenAI Service (not direct OpenAI API)
- **Semantic Kernel Integration**: Maintain native integration with framework
- **Regional Deployment**: Support data residency requirements
- **Cost Management**: Implement proper quotas and monitoring
- **Compliance**: Ensure enterprise-grade security and compliance
