          ## 🧹 PR Environment Cleanup Skipped

          The environment cleanup was skipped (likely due to missing Azure credentials).

          ${{ github.event.pull_request.merged && '✅ **Merged**: Changes are now available in the main branch' || '❌ **Closed**: No changes were merged' }}

          > **Note**: Manual cleanup may be required if resources were deployed.
