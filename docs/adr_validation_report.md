- **Implementation Status**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT**
- **Evidence**:
  - ✅ All 6 specialized agents implemented:
    - `DungeonMasterAgent` (Orchestrator)
    - `NarratorAgent` (Campaign narrative)
    - `ScribeAgent` (Character/data management)
    - `CombatMCAgent` (Combat encounters)
    - `CombatCartographerAgent` (Battle maps)
    - `ArtistAgent` (Visual imagery)
  - ✅ Each agent has distinct responsibilities as specified
  - ✅ Agent class structure supports orchestration model

### ADR 0003: Data Storage Strategy for Game State and Assets
- **Status**: ✅ Accepted
- **Implementation Status**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT**
- **Decision**: Use "Hybrid Approach with Semantic Memory" with backing storage
- **Current Reality**: SQLAlchemy-based persistent storage implemented

**Evidence of Full Compliance**:
- ✅ Persistent database storage implemented (`database.py`)
- ✅ SQLAlchemy ORM models for game data (`db_models.py`)
- ✅ Database session management and initialization
- ✅ Character data stored persistently in database
- ✅ Agent integration with storage layer (ScribeAgent)

**Example from ScribeAgent**:
```python
# Persistent storage implementation
with next(get_session()) as db:
    db_character = Character(
        id=character_id, name=character_sheet["name"], data=character_sheet
    )
    db.add(db_character)
    db.commit()
```

**Compliance Assessment**: Storage strategy fully implemented with SQLAlchemy providing the persistent backing store as specified in the ADR.

### ADR 0004: React and TypeScript Frontend Architecture
- **Status**: ✅ Accepted
- **Implementation Status**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT**
- **Evidence**:
  - ✅ React framework implemented (`package.json` shows React dependencies)
  - ✅ TypeScript configuration complete (`tsconfig.json`)
  - ✅ All UI components implemented in TypeScript:
    - ChatBox, CharacterSheet, GameInterface, BattleMap, ImageDisplay, CampaignCreation
  - ✅ Type-safe API interfaces defined
  - ✅ Build system working (successful `npm run build`)
  - ✅ Component-based architecture as specified

**Compliance Assessment**: This ADR is exemplary in its implementation. Frontend architecture fully matches the architectural decision.

### ADR 0005: Azure OpenAI Integration for AI Agents
- **Status**: ✅ Accepted
- **Implementation Status**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT**
- **Decision**: Use Azure OpenAI Service for enterprise-grade LLM capabilities
- **Current Reality**: Azure OpenAI client implemented and integrated

**Evidence of Full Compliance**:
- ✅ Azure OpenAI client implementation (`azure_openai_client.py`)
- ✅ AI model configuration with deployment settings
- ✅ Authentication setup for Azure services via environment variables
- ✅ Integration with Semantic Kernel for Azure OpenAI services
- ✅ Chat completion and embedding services configured
- ✅ Retry logic and error handling implemented

**Example from AzureOpenAIClient**:
```python
class AzureOpenAIClient:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        openai.api_type = "azure"
        openai.api_version = settings.azure_openai_api_version
        openai.api_key = settings.azure_openai_api_key
        openai.base_url = settings.azure_openai_endpoint
```

**Compliance Assessment**: Azure OpenAI integration fully implemented with proper authentication, configuration, and service integration.
