# Dice Rolling System Enhancement Issue

## Issue Summary

Develop and integrate a comprehensive dice-rolling system that fully supports D&D 5e mechanics including all standard dice types, complex roll scenarios (advantage, disadvantage), and custom modifiers.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Capabilities ✅
- Basic dice notation parsing (e.g., "2d6+3", "1d20-2")
- Support for all standard D&D 5e dice types (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100)
- Simple positive and negative modifiers (+/-)
- Advantage/disadvantage mechanics in skill checks and attack rolls
- Critical hit mechanics in damage calculation
- Error handling for invalid dice notation

### Current Limitations ❌
1. **Limited Complex Modifiers**: Only supports simple +/- modifiers, not complex formulas
2. **Missing Advanced D&D 5e Mechanics**: 
   - Exploding dice (for some homebrew rules)
   - Drop lowest/highest dice (e.g., 4d6 drop lowest for ability scores)
   - Reroll mechanics (e.g., Great Weapon Fighting)
   - Multiple dice pools with different operations
3. **Inconsistent Integration**: Advantage/disadvantage logic is duplicated across skill_check and resolve_attack functions
4. **Limited User Input Flexibility**: No support for user-provided roll results
5. **Missing Roll History**: No persistent tracking of roll sequences for verification
6. **No Roll Validation**: No validation against character abilities or spell slot usage

## Requirements

### Core Dice Rolling Enhancement

#### 1. Advanced Dice Notation Support
- **Current**: `XdY+Z` or `XdY-Z`
- **Required**: Support for complex expressions:
  - `4d6dl1` - Roll 4d6, drop lowest 1
  - `2d20kh1` - Roll 2d20, keep highest 1 (advantage)
  - `2d20kl1` - Roll 2d20, keep lowest 1 (disadvantage) 
  - `1d6!` - Exploding dice (reroll on max value)
  - `1d6r1` - Reroll on 1 (Great Weapon Fighting)
  - `3d6+2d4+5` - Multiple dice pools with modifiers

#### 2. Enhanced D&D 5e Specific Features
- **Advantage/Disadvantage Consolidation**: Single reusable function for advantage/disadvantage rolls
- **Ability Score Generation**: `4d6dl1` repeated 6 times for character creation
- **Saving Throws**: Integration with character proficiency and abilities
- **Attack Rolls**: Separate handling for different attack types (melee, ranged, spell)
- **Damage Rolls**: Support for multiple damage types in single expression
- **Critical Hit Enhancement**: Configurable critical hit rules (double dice vs max+dice)

#### 3. User Roll Input System
- **Manual Roll Entry**: Allow users to input their own physical dice results
- **Roll Verification**: Option to verify user-entered rolls against probability expectations
- **Mixed Rolling**: Combine system rolls with user rolls in same expression

#### 4. Roll History and Analytics
- **Session Roll Log**: Track all rolls in a session for review
- **Statistical Analysis**: Provide roll statistics and probability analysis
- **Roll Replay**: Ability to replay specific roll sequences
- **Audit Trail**: Timestamp and context for each roll

### Integration Requirements

#### 1. Agent System Integration
- **Rules Engine Plugin Enhancement**: Extend existing `RulesEnginePlugin` with new capabilities
- **Consistent API**: Maintain backward compatibility while adding new features
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with meaningful error messages
- **Performance**: Efficient parsing and execution of complex dice expressions

#### 2. Character Sheet Integration
- **Ability Modifiers**: Automatic application of character ability modifiers
- **Proficiency Bonuses**: Integration with character proficiency system
- **Equipment Bonuses**: Support for weapon and armor bonuses
- **Spell Integration**: Dice rolling for spell damage and effects

#### 3. Combat System Integration
- **Initiative Rolls**: Automated initiative rolling with dexterity modifier
- **Attack Resolution**: Complete attack roll → damage roll workflow
- **Condition Effects**: Apply advantage/disadvantage based on character conditions
- **Multi-Attack Support**: Handle multiple attacks in single turn

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Dice Expression Parser
```python
class DiceExpressionParser:
    """Enhanced parser for complex dice expressions"""
    
    def parse(self, expression: str) -> DiceExpression:
        """Parse dice expression into executable components"""
        
    def validate(self, expression: str) -> bool:
        """Validate dice expression syntax"""
```

#### 2. Enhanced Roll Result Structure
```python
class RollResult:
    """Comprehensive roll result with full details"""
    
    expression: str
    individual_rolls: List[List[int]]  # Grouped by dice type
    modifiers: Dict[str, int]
    operations: List[str]  # Operations performed (drop, keep, etc.)
    total: int
    breakdown: str  # Human-readable breakdown
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]  # Context and additional info
```

#### 3. Character Context Integration
```python
class CharacterDiceContext:
    """Character-specific context for dice rolling"""
    
    ability_scores: Dict[str, int]
    proficiencies: List[str]
    equipment_bonuses: Dict[str, int]
    conditions: List[str]  # Advantage/disadvantage sources
```

### User Stories

#### As a Player
1. **Complex Ability Generation**: "I want to roll 4d6 drop lowest for each ability score during character creation"
2. **Flexible Attack Rolling**: "I want advantage on my attack roll because I'm hidden, and I want to see both d20 results"
3. **Spell Damage Calculation**: "I want to roll 8d6 fireball damage and have it automatically apply to multiple targets"
4. **Physical Dice Integration**: "I want to use my physical dice and enter the results while the system handles the modifiers"

#### As a Dungeon Master (AI)
1. **Automated Combat**: "I want to roll initiative for all NPCs and sort turn order automatically"
2. **Damage Resistance**: "I want to automatically halve damage for resistant creatures"
3. **Spell Save Management**: "I want to track spell save DCs and automatically determine success/failure"
