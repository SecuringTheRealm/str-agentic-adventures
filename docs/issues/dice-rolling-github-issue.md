# Issue: Enhance Dice Rolling System for Complete D&D 5e Support

## 🎯 Summary
Develop and integrate a comprehensive dice-rolling system that fully supports D&D 5e mechanics including complex roll scenarios (advantage, disadvantage, drop/keep dice) and custom modifiers beyond the current basic implementation.

## 📋 Current State vs Required

### ✅ What Works Now
- Basic dice notation: `2d6+3`, `1d20-2`  
- All standard dice types: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100
- Simple modifiers (+/-)
- Advantage/disadvantage in skill checks and attacks
- Critical hit damage doubling

### ❌ What's Missing  
- **Advanced notation**: `4d6dl1` (drop lowest), `2d20kh1` (keep highest)
- **Reroll mechanics**: Great Weapon Fighting, Halfling Lucky
- **Multiple dice pools**: `3d6+2d4+5`
- **User manual input**: "I rolled a 15 on my physical d20"
- **Roll history tracking**: Session roll audit trail
- **Character integration**: Auto-apply ability modifiers and proficiency

## 🎲 Required Features

### Core Dice Enhancements
1. **Advanced Notation Support**
   ```
   4d6dl1       # Drop lowest 1 (ability scores)
   2d20kh1      # Keep highest 1 (advantage)  
   2d20kl1      # Keep lowest 1 (disadvantage)
   1d6r1        # Reroll on 1 (Great Weapon Fighting)
   3d6+2d4+5    # Multiple dice pools
   ```

2. **D&D 5e Specific Integration**
   - Consolidated advantage/disadvantage system (no more duplication)
   - Character ability score generation (6 × 4d6dl1)
   - Automatic modifier application from character sheets
   - Spell save DC calculations and checks

3. **User Experience Features**
   - Manual roll input: "I rolled 18 on my d20"
   - Roll history with timestamps and context
   - Detailed breakdown: "18 [d20] + 3 [STR] + 2 [prof] = 23"
   - Statistical roll analysis for sessions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Plugin Structure
```python
# Extend existing RulesEnginePlugin
class EnhancedDiceRoller:
    def roll_advanced(self, expression: str, context: CharacterContext = None) -> DetailedRollResult
    def apply_advantage_disadvantage(self, base_roll: str, condition: str) -> RollResult  
    def manual_roll_input(self, dice_type: str, result: int, context: str) -> RollResult
    def generate_ability_scores(self) -> Dict[str, int]  # 6 × 4d6dl1
```

### Character Integration  
```python
class CharacterDiceContext:
    ability_modifiers: Dict[str, int]    # STR: +3, DEX: +2, etc.
    proficiency_bonus: int               # +2, +3, etc.
    equipment_bonuses: Dict[str, int]    # weapon: +1, etc.
    conditions: List[str]                # ["hidden", "blessed"]
```

## 🎯 User Stories

**As a Player:**
- I want to roll 4d6 drop lowest for ability scores during character creation
- I want advantage on stealth checks to automatically roll 2d20 and take the higher result  
- I want to input my physical dice roll while the system handles all modifiers
- I want to see a complete breakdown of my roll calculation

**As the AI DM:**
- I want to automatically apply character modifiers to all rolls
- I want to track all rolls in combat for verification and balancing
- I want to handle complex spell effects that involve multiple dice types

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All D&D 5e dice mechanics supported with advanced notation
- [ ] Zero breaking changes to existing `roll_dice()` functionality  
- [ ] Character sheet integration auto-applies modifiers
- [ ] Manual and system rolls work seamlessly together
- [ ] Roll history provides complete audit trail
- [ ] Performance: <100ms for complex multi-dice expressions
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage on new functionality

## 🗂️ Implementation Plan

**Phase 1 (High Priority):** Advanced notation parser + enhanced RollResult structure
**Phase 2 (High Priority):** Character context integration + advantage/disadvantage consolidation  
**Phase 3 (Medium Priority):** Manual roll input + roll history tracking
**Phase 4 (Low Priority):** Statistical analysis + performance optimization
