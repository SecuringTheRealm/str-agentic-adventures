# Specialized Multi-Agent Architecture for AI Dungeon Master

* Status: accepted
* Date: 2025-06-10

## Context and Problem Statement

A tabletop RPG experience involves multiple complex components including narration, rules management, combat, character tracking, and visual elements. We need to decide how to structure our AI system to handle these diverse responsibilities while maintaining a cohesive player experience.

## Decision Drivers

* Need to manage multiple complex responsibilities simultaneously
* Requirement for specialized knowledge domains (narrative, rules, combat, etc.)
* Need for consistent player interaction despite backend complexity
* Desire to optimize each function without compromising others
* Maintaining coherence across the gaming experience

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Single Large AI Agent Model
    * One large agent handles all tasks
    * Pros:
      * Simpler architecture
      * Consistent "voice" for player interactions
      * No need for complex agent communication
    * Cons:
      * Token context limits restrict complexity handling
      * Difficult to optimize for specialized tasks
      * Poor separation of concerns
      * Challenge with maintaining specialized knowledge

* Option 2: Specialized Multi-Agent Architecture
    * Multiple agents with specialized roles coordinated by an orchestrator
    * Pros:
      * Better separation of concerns
      * Each agent can be optimized for its specific function
      * More effective use of token context windows
      * Can maintain specialized knowledge domains
    * Cons:
      * More complex architecture
      * Requires sophisticated inter-agent communication
      * Potential for inconsistency in player experience

* Option 3: Hierarchical Agents with Shared Memory
    * Multiple specialized agents with hierarchical structure and shared memory
    * Pros:
      * Balances specialization with coherence
      * Enables knowledge sharing
      * Clear command structure
    * Cons:
      * Complex shared memory management
      * More sophisticated coordination required
      * Higher latency due to multiple agent calls

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Specialized Multi-Agent Architecture"

Justification:
* The diverse requirements of a tabletop RPG (narration, rules, combat, visuals) naturally fit specialized roles
* Semantic Kernel provides tools to manage inter-agent communication effectively
* Each agent can be optimized for its specific knowledge domain without compromising others
* The orchestration pattern with a Dungeon Master agent ensures a consistent player experience

## Consequences

### Positive
* Each agent can focus on excellence in its domain
* More efficient use of token context windows
* Better separation of concerns improves maintainability
* Flexibility to evolve individual agents without affecting others

### Negative
* More complex coordination between agents
* Increased latency due to multiple agent calls
* Potential for inconsistency in responses

### Risks and Mitigations
* Risk: Inconsistent player experience due to multiple agent "voices"
  * Mitigation: Dungeon Master agent will synthesize and standardize responses
* Risk: Increased latency affects user experience
  * Mitigation: Selective agent invocation and parallel processing where possible
* Risk: Complex inter-agent communication leads to errors
  * Mitigation: Robust logging and monitoring of agent interactions
