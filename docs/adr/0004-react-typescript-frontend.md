# React and TypeScript Frontend Architecture

* Status: accepted
* Date: 2025-06-10

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to create a responsive, engaging user interface for the AI Dungeon Master that supports real-time interactions, visual elements, and game state visualization. We need to decide on the frontend architecture and technologies.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for responsive UI with real-time updates
* Support for chat interface as primary interaction method
* Display of visual elements (battle maps, character portraits)
* Character sheet and game state visualization
* Integration with backend services

## Considered Options

* Option 1: React with TypeScript
    * Modern component-based UI framework with type safety
    * Pros:
      * Strong typing improves reliability
      * Large ecosystem of libraries
      * Component reusability
      * Strong developer ecosystem and tooling
    * Cons:
      * Learning curve for TypeScript
      * May be over-engineered for simpler UIs

* Option 2: Vue.js
    * Progressive JavaScript framework
    * Pros:
      * More approachable learning curve
      * Good performance
      * Built-in state management for smaller apps
    * Cons:
      * Smaller ecosystem than React
      * Less common for complex enterprise applications
      * Fewer TypeScript-focused libraries

* Option 3: Plain JavaScript/HTML/CSS
    * Vanilla web technologies without framework
    * Pros:
      * No framework overhead
      * Full control over implementation
    * Cons:
      * Lower developer productivity
      * Harder to maintain complex UI state
      * Limited component reuse

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "React with TypeScript"

Justification:
* TypeScript provides type safety which reduces bugs in complex UI interactions
* React's component model supports the multiple UI elements needed (chat, character sheet, maps)
* Large ecosystem provides libraries for key features like chat interfaces
* TypeScript aligns with our backend using Semantic Kernel's TypeScript SDK if needed
* Industry standard with good hiring pool

## Consequences

### Positive
* Strong type safety improves code quality
* Component-based architecture supports our complex UI requirements
* Rich ecosystem provides solutions for common patterns
* Good performance for interactive applications

### Negative
* Higher learning curve for team members new to TypeScript
* More complex build configuration
* Potential over-engineering for simpler UI components

### Risks and Mitigations
* Risk: Overuse of complex patterns for simple UI components
  * Mitigation: Establish coding standards promoting simplicity where appropriate
* Risk: Build configuration complexity
  * Mitigation: Use established tooling like Create React App or Next.js
* Risk: Learning curve for team
  * Mitigation: Training and pair programming
