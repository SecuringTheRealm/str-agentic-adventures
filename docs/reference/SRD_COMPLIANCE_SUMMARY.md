# D&D 5e SRD Compliance Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the SRD compliance improvements implemented to address issue #343.

## Overview

The implementation adds comprehensive D&D 5e SRD compliance features while maintaining minimal code changes and preserving the existing architecture. The focus was on addressing the most critical compliance gaps identified in the issue.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Class Features System
- **Data File**: `backend/app/data/class_features.json`
- **Coverage**: All 12 core classes with level 1-5 features
- **Integration**: Level-up automatically grants appropriate class features
- **Examples**: 
  - Fighter: Fighting Style, Second Wind, Action Surge, Extra Attack
  - Wizard: Spellcasting, Arcane Recovery, Arcane Tradition
  - Barbarian: Rage, Unarmored Defense, Reckless Attack

### 2. Racial Traits System
- **Data File**: `backend/app/data/racial_traits.json`
- **Coverage**: All 9 SRD races with complete traits
- **Features**:
  - Ability score bonuses (+2 DEX for elves, +2 CON for dwarves, etc.)
  - Speed adjustments (25 ft for dwarves/halflings)
  - Racial traits (Darkvision, Fey Ancestry, Dwarven Resilience, etc.)
- **Integration**: Applied automatically during character creation

### 3. Background System
- **Data File**: `backend/app/data/backgrounds.json`
- **Coverage**: 6 core SRD backgrounds
- **Features**:
  - Skill proficiencies (Acolyte: Insight + Religion)
  - Background features (Military Rank, Shelter of the Faithful, etc.)
- **Integration**: Skills and features applied during character creation

### 4. Enhanced Spell System
- **Data File**: `backend/app/data/spells.json`
- **Improvement**: Expanded from 3 to 15+ SRD spells
- **Features**:
  - Complete spell attributes (components, concentration, duration)
  - Class availability filtering
  - Proper spell school and level organization
- **Integration**: Spell list API now uses SRD data

### 5. Character Creation Overhaul
- **Racial Bonuses**: Automatically applied during creation
- **Class Features**: Level 1 features granted immediately
- **Saving Throws**: Class proficiencies assigned
- **Background Skills**: Automatic skill proficiency assignment
- **HP Calculation**: Proper calculation with racial bonuses and class hit dice
- **Speed**: Race-based speed calculation

## Technical Implementation

### Data Layer
- **SRD Data Module**: `backend/app/srd_data.py` - Centralized data access
- **JSON Data Files**: Structured, maintainable SRD content
- **Lazy Loading**: Data loaded on first access for performance

### Integration Points
- **Character Creation**: Enhanced `ScribeAgent.create_character()`
- **Level Up**: Enhanced level-up to grant class features
- **API Endpoints**: Updated spell list endpoint to use SRD data
- **Models**: Extended `CreateCharacterRequest` to support backgrounds

### Test Coverage
- **9 Comprehensive Tests**: Cover all major SRD features
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end character creation workflows
- **Manual Test Script**: Demonstrates complete functionality
- **Examples**: 
  - Dwarf Fighter with Soldier background
  - Elf Wizard with Sage background

## SRD Compliance Improvements

### Before Implementation
- Characters created with flat ability scores (no racial bonuses)
- No class features beyond basic stats
- Empty features list
- Limited spell system (3 hardcoded spells)
- No background support
- Generic HP/speed for all characters

### After Implementation
- **Dwarf Fighter Example**:
  - Gets +2 CON racial bonus (15 → 17)
  - 25 ft speed (dwarf racial)
  - Class features: Fighting Style, Second Wind
  - Racial traits: Darkvision, Dwarven Resilience, etc.
  - Background skills: Athletics, Intimidation (Soldier)
  - Proper HP: 13 (d10 + 3 CON modifier)
  - Saving throws: Strength, Constitution

## Areas Addressed from Issue #343

✅ **Hit Dice**: Class-specific hit dice assignment
✅ **Feature Tracking**: All features tracked with source and level

## Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a solid foundation for additional SRD features:
- Subclass support (data structure exists, needs implementation)
- Feat system (groundwork in place)
- Combat conditions system
- Equipment expansion
- Monster stat blocks

## Code Quality

- **Minimal Changes**: Focused on essential SRD compliance
- **Maintainable**: Structured data files for easy updates
- **Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Compatible**: Works with existing architecture
- **Documented**: Clear documentation and examples

## Validation

The implementation successfully creates D&D 5e SRD-compliant characters with:
- Proper racial ability bonuses and traits
- Appropriate class features and proficiencies
- Background skills and features
- Correct HP, speed, and saving throw calculations
- Enhanced spell system with SRD content

This addresses the major SRD compliance gaps while maintaining the system's flexibility and extensibility.
