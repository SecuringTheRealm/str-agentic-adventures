- ❌ **Blob Storage**: No file/image storage system
- ❌ **Session Management**: No persistent game state

### User Experience
- ❌ **Dice Roll Visualization**: No visual feedback for dice outcomes
- ❌ **Real-time Updates**: No live game state synchronization
- ❌ **Session History**: No conversation or event logging
- ❌ **Character Backstory Integration**: No narrative incorporation of player backgrounds

## User Stories Implementation Summary

### Player Stories (9 total)
- **Implemented**: 1/9 (11%) - Basic character creation interface
- **Partially Implemented**: 3/9 (33%) - Chat interface, character display, session structure
- **Not Implemented**: 5/9 (56%) - AI interaction, dice rolling, combat, visuals, narrative

### Dungeon Master (AI) Stories (8 total)
- **Implemented**: 0/8 (0%)
- **Partially Implemented**: 2/8 (25%) - Agent structure, rule framework
- **Not Implemented**: 6/8 (75%) - All core AI DM functionality

## Implementation Phase Status

- **Phase 1 (Core Agent Framework)**: 40% complete
- **Phase 2 (Game Rules Implementation)**: 10% complete  
- **Phase 3 (Enhanced Agent Intelligence)**: 5% complete
- **Phase 4 (Visual Elements)**: 5% complete
- **Phase 5 (Advanced Features)**: 0% complete

## Overall Assessment

The project has established a **solid architectural foundation** with excellent frontend implementation and proper API structure. However, the **core functionality that makes this an AI Dungeon Master is not yet implemented**. The current state represents approximately **15-20% of the planned feature set**.

**Strengths:**
- Well-structured codebase
- Complete UI component framework
- Type-safe implementation
- Good architectural decisions

**Critical Gaps:**
- No actual AI integration
- No game mechanics implementation
- No persistent data storage
- No visual generation capabilities

The project is well-positioned for rapid development but requires significant engineering effort to implement the core AI and gaming features that deliver the product vision.
