# Backend Container Optimization

## Summary of Changes

The backend container build has been optimized for faster builds, smaller image size, and better security:

### Key Improvements

1. **Multi-stage Build**: Separates build dependencies from runtime, reducing final image size by 36.5%
2. **Certificate Issue Resolution**: Uses UV installer script instead of pip to avoid SSL certificate issues
3. **Security Enhancements**: Runs as non-root user (appuser) with proper file permissions
4. **Minimal System Dependencies**: Only installs essential runtime packages (ca-certificates)
5. **Better Layer Caching**: Optimized layer structure for faster subsequent builds

### Before vs After

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Image Size | 905MB | 574MB | -331MB (-36.5%) |
| System Packages | Many unnecessary (gcc, graphics libs, etc.) | Minimal (ca-certificates only) | Reduced attack surface |
| User Security | Root user | Non-root (appuser) | Enhanced security |
| Build Method | Single stage with dev tools | Multi-stage production build | Cleaner runtime |

### Technical Details

**Base Image**: `python:3.12-slim-bookworm`
**Dependency Manager**: UV (installed via curl script to avoid SSL issues)
**Runtime User**: `appuser` (non-root)
**Health Check**: Optimized timeout and retry settings
**Build Context**: Reduced via improved .dockerignore

### Build Process

1. **Stage 1 (builder)**: Installs UV and builds dependencies in virtual environment
2. **Stage 2 (runtime)**: Copies only the virtual environment and application code
3. **Security**: Creates non-root user and sets proper permissions
4. **Optimization**: Compiles bytecode and uses efficient linking

The optimized container is now production-ready with significant improvements in size, security, and build reliability.
