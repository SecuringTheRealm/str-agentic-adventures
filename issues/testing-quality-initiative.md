# Testing Quality Initiative (Master Tracking)

## Overview
Central tracker for improving overall test quality, coverage, reliability, performance, and security across the project.

## Objectives
- Achieve reliable, fast, maintainable test suites across all layers.
- Establish clear quality gates (lint, static analysis, coverage thresholds, security scanning).
- Reduce test flakiness and improve developer confidence.

## Scope / Child Work
The following issues compose this initiative (link numbers after creation):
- Review and Refactor Unit Tests
- Audit and Stabilize Integration Tests
- Harden End-to-End Test Suite
- Review Frontend Component & UI Tests
- Establish & Validate API Contract Tests
- Establish Performance & Load Testing Baseline
- Security & Dependency Health Improvements
- Lint & Static Analysis Quality Gate
- Add Coverage Reporting & Enforce Threshold

## Success Metrics
- < X% -> Y% line/function/branch coverage (baseline to be added).
- 0 flaky tests over N consecutive CI runs.
- Median CI test duration reduced (record baseline & target).
- Automated security & dependency scans run on each merge / scheduled.
