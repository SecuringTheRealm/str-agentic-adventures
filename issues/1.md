# Testing Initiative 1/9: Review and Refactor Unit Tests

## Goal
Audit all unit tests for clarity, reliability, speed, and coverage gaps.

## Tasks
- Inventory unit test locations (list paths in follow-up comment).
- Remove or rewrite brittle / redundant tests.
- Add tests for critical logic paths currently uncovered.
- Standardize naming (test_*, *_test).
- Ensure deterministic setup/teardown (no cross-test state bleed).
- Introduce/validate fast test pattern (e.g. isolate pure logic).
- Document how to run unit tests locally and in CI.

## Definition of Done
- All unit tests pass in N (>=3) consecutive CI runs.
- Baseline coverage (line/branch/function) captured and posted.
- No test exceeds X seconds (decide threshold).
- docs/testing/unit.md added or updated.
