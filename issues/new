{\n  "title": "Testing Initiative 1/9: Review and Refactor Unit Tests",\n  "body": "Goal\n  Audit all unit tests for clarity, reliability, speed, and coverage gaps.\n  \n  Tasks\n  - Inventory unit test locations (list paths in follow-up comment).\n  - Remove or rewrite brittle / redundant tests.\n  - Add tests for critical logic paths currently uncovered.\n  - Standardize naming (test_*, *_test).\n  - Ensure deterministic setup/teardown (no cross-test state bleed).\n  - Introduce/validate fast test pattern (e.g. isolate pure logic).\n  - Document how to run unit tests locally and in CI.\n  \n  Definition of Done\n  - All unit tests pass in N (>=3) consecutive CI runs.\n  - Baseline coverage (line/branch/function) captured and posted.\n  - No test exceeds X seconds (decide threshold).\n  - docs/testing/unit.md added or updated.",\n  "assignee": "Sealjay",\n  "labels": ["testing", "quality", "tech-debt"]\n}
